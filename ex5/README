usage:	python3 perceptron.py 


==================
=  Description:  =
==================
This program uses the perceptron algorithm to try and find a classifier on a
given data set, which it can later try and use on larger data sets to classify
them accordingly. 
The Perceptron algorithm searches for a mistake between the given label in the
training data and updates his weights and bias to try and compensate for this
until a classifier can be found.
After 10x(size of data) runs, if a classifier cannot be found it returns a 
None classifier.

question 5:

the reason our algorithm made a mistake is becuase of a mistake of labels
and an example which is strongly on the line between a 4 and 7 .

mistake in label 57 is that it seems alot like a 7 because of the cross
line and the "missing" line up top. It seems alot like label 123 which is a 7.

mistake in label 118 which is supposed to be 1.0 but is -1.0
meaning our algorithm does find it but the label is incorrect

Bonus question 6:

The problem with out current perceptron is that he searches for a linear type
of classification while the data set cannot be separated linearly. This type
data set requires a different type of classification and most likely requires
an “eclipse” type of classification ( (x^2)/a + (y^2)/b = 1). This sort of 
classification on a 2 dimensional axis might give the right classifier for 
this data set. Currently our classifier is a 1 dimensional one.
