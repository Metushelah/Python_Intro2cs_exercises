usage:	python3 palindrome.py
        python3 balanced_brackets.py
        python3 y_tree.py


==================
=  Description:  =
==================
These programs use recursion in order to solve some problems such as checking
if a string is a palindrome between two indexes or if the string given is
balanced according to the amount of closes inside it.

palindrome.py		    This program checks if a string is a "palindrome" on 
                        it's whole or if it's a palindrome between two indexes
                        given.
balanced_brackets.py    Checks if the brackets inside the string are balanced.
                        Checks where the first error of inbalance occurs.
                        Returns a list with the number signifiying the position
                        of the brackets in relation to it's opening of closing
                        one.
y_tree.py               draws a tree recursively
