=  README for ex7: Image morphing =
===================================

usage:	python3 gui.py <image_source> <image_target> <num_frames> <out_dir>
                                                        <max_x> <max_y>


==================
=  Description:  =
==================
These programs take in 2 images and gets the points submitted by the user
to create matching triangles on the 2 images. From there it creates
intermediate images between the source and target image so it will be able to
see the images morph from one to the other.

ex7.py      		    This program hold different helper functions to the
                        gui.py program calling them. 
                        It handles the points and the triangle creation, the 
                        creation of intermediate triangles and images and in
                        the end creates a folder with the intermediate images
                        so a movie can be made from them.
