=  README for ex3: Lord of The Rings  =
=======================================

usage:	python3 findLargest.py  
        python3 findSecondSmallest.py
        python3 TotalWeight.py
        python3 twoDimensionalSeek.py
        python3 ithElementValue.py
        python3 decomposition.py
        python3 binaryToDecimal.py
        python3 decimalToBinary.py


==================
=  Description:  =
==================
Third exercise.
These are 8 small programs each doing something else under the theme 
of Lord Of The Rings.

README			        This file

findLargest.py          Prints the position of the largest number according
                        to a given number of inputs specified at start

findSecondSmallest.py   Prints the position of the second Smallest number out
                        of 10 inputs given

TotalWeight.py          Prints the total sum of numbers up to 100 or else
                        -1 is given and prints the sum
                        
twoDimensionalSeek.py   Prints the number of step needed from start to
                        reach the position in the end of a right/left journey
                        
ithElementValue.py      Prints the ithElement in a fibonnacci sequence

decomposition.py        Prints the number given through it's digit

binaryToDecimal.py      Prints the binary number given in decimal

decimalToBinary.py      Prints the decimal number given in binary

Answer for question 9:
- there main difference between the two exercises is that while you trying
    to convert from a smaller base to a larger one you need to multiple each
    remainder in a growing step multiplied by the base you converting to.
    From a bigger base to a smaller one you use the remainder each time 
    until you get to the end.
    
- after reading this question i actually got the idea to do it, and i used the
    remainder from the division each time. So the small change needed is using
    the remainder of dividing by 2 each time without multiplying by the growing
    base.
    
- yes we could make an easy algorithm using those two programms we made
    allowing for the base to be entered and then converting the number from
    that base into decimal and from decimal down into the new base wanted.
